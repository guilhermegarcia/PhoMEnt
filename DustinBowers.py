Word to the wise:
On my old-ish computer, GitHub did not play nice. Terminal commands for keychain
didn't work, and despite slavishly copying down the Terminal instructions,
there were many errors that Google couldn't solve.

Don't lose heart though. The GUIs are prone to complain as well, but I got some
things to work.

I am using Mac OS X 10.6, the helpful GUI was "SourceTree"."""
